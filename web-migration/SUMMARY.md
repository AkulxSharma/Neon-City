# Neon City Drive — Web Migration

Rewriting the single-file `index.html` game (repo root) into a real web app:
Next.js + React Three Fiber (three.js for React) + Rapier (physics engine) +
zustand (HUD state). The original file is untouched and still fully playable —
this folder is a from-scratch parallel build, following the phased plan below.
Nothing here is wired back into the original game yet.

## How to run

```bash
cd web-migration
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

WASD/arrows to drive, Space to handbrake. One car, a flat test arena with a
few boxes to crash into — that's it so far (see Milestones).

## Migration phases

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Next.js scaffold, full-viewport Canvas, day/night sky cycle, ground | ✅ done |
| 1 | Minimal driving arena (ground + boundary walls + a few static buildings as Rapier fixed colliders) — full chunk-streamed city comes later | ✅ done (minimal slice) |
| 2 | **Validation vehicle**: one car, arcade physics ported from the original game, collision via Rapier's `KinematicCharacterController` | ✅ done — feel holds up, see below |
| 3 | Remaining vehicle types (bikes, boats w/ buoyancy), traffic AI | ⏳ not started |
| 4 | HUD → real React components (speedo done as a proof of concept via zustand) | ◐ speedo only |
| 5 | Audio, save/load, club interior, police convoy, boat-swap, police station | ⏳ not started |
| 6 | Instance repeated props, perf pass, deploy | ⏳ not started |

## Milestone 1 — Phase 0–2: physics validation (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** prove the architecture before porting the other ~7,500 lines. The
real risk was always Phase 2 — does an arcade "feel" hand-tuned in raw
position-integration code survive a move to a real physics engine?

**Decision: kinematic body + Rapier's `KinematicCharacterController`, not a
dynamic rigid body.** The original plan said "apply forces to a dynamic rigid
body." In practice that means re-deriving the whole feel from scratch via
force/impulse tuning — high risk, high effort, and Rapier's dynamics are not
what a hand-tuned arcade racer wants anyway. Instead: `lib/carPhysics.ts` is
the *exact* velocity/steering math from the original `tick()` (steering ramp,
engine/drag, lateral grip), untouched. Each frame it produces a desired
`(dx, dz)`; Rapier's `KinematicCharacterController.computeColliderMovement()`
takes that desired move and returns a corrected one that slides along
obstacles instead of just stopping dead — a straight upgrade over the
original's hand-rolled AABB push-out, with zero risk to the feel. This is the
real "improved physics" the migration was asked for: not different-feeling
driving, but collision that works properly against real geometry (angles,
corners, stacked shapes) instead of axis-aligned boxes.

**Bug hit and fixed:** the very first working build crashed on load with
`recursive use of an object detected which would lead to unsafe aliasing in
rust` / `null pointer passed to rust`, thrown from inside Rapier's WASM.
Ruled out, in order: React StrictMode (disabled it, still crashed — later
re-enabled once the real cause was found and confirmed it wasn't this),
Turbopack vs. webpack (tried both, same crash — not a bundler issue), a
duplicate nested `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat` install (real issue, fixed by
pinning the exact version `@react-three/rapier` expects so npm dedupes to one
copy — but not the crash's cause). Isolated it by building a bare test scene
and adding pieces back one at a time: `Physics` + static bodies alone → fine;
adding a kinematic body → fine; creating a `KinematicCharacterController` in
`useEffect` → fine; calling `body.collider(0)` **inside `useFrame`, every
frame** → crash, reproduced exactly. Querying a rigid body's collider by index
from inside the render loop re-enters Rapier's internal borrow while the
physics step (also running via `useFrame`) holds it. Fix: stop querying it —
render an explicit `<CuboidCollider ref={colliderRef}>` as a child of the
`RigidBody` (with `colliders={false}` on the body itself) and use that stable
ref every frame instead. No more dynamic lookups, no more crash, confirmed
stable with StrictMode back on.

**Files:**
- `lib/carPhysics.ts` — the ported arcade math, pure function, framework-agnostic
- `lib/useKeyboard.ts` — keyboard state in a ref (no re-renders)
- `lib/hudStore.ts` — zustand store for the speedo
- `components/Car.tsx` — kinematic RigidBody + character controller + chase camera
- `components/World.tsx` — ground, boundary walls, a handful of test buildings
- `components/SkyCycle.tsx` — day/night background + sun lerp
- `components/Game.tsx` / `components/HUD.tsx` — top-level wiring
- `app/page.tsx` — client-only dynamic import (Canvas/WASM can't SSR)

## Next up

Phase 3: port one boat (needs custom buoyancy — Rapier has no water) and one
bike, then the traffic AI. Will report back at the next milestone.
